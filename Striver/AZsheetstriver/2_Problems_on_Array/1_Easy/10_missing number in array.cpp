ntuition + Approach: 

The idea is to convert the given problem into mathematical equations. Since we have two variables where one is missing and one is repeating, can we form two linear equations and then solve for the values of these two variables using the equations?

Let’s see how.

Assume the missing number to be X and the repeating one to be Y.

Now since the numbers are from 1 to N in the array arr[]. Let’s calculate sum of all integers from 1 to N and sum of squares of all integers from 1 to N. These can easily be done using mathematical formulae.

Therefore,

Sum of all elements from 1 to N:

S = N*(N+1)/2 ---- equation 1
And, Sum of squares of all elements from 1 to N:

P = N(N+1)(2N+1)/6. ----- equation 2
Similarly, find the sum of all elements of the array and sum of squares of all elements of the array respectively.

s1 = Sum of all elements of the array. —– equation 3
P1 = Sum of squares of all elements of the array. ——– equation 4
Now, if we subtract the sum of all elements of array from sum of all elements from 1 to N, that should give us the value for (X – Y).

Therefore,

(X-Y) = s – s1 = s’

Similarily,

X^2 – Y^2 = P – P1 = P’

or, (X + Y)(X – Y) = P’

or, (X + Y)*s’ = P’

or, X + Y = P’/s’

Great,

we have the two equations we needed:

(X – Y) = s’

(X + Y) = P’/s’

We can use the two equations to solve and find values for X and Y respectively.

Note: here s and P can be large so take long long int data type.
